LINUX COMMAND CHEATSHEET BASH TOOLS
---
```
I use this to quickly lookup Linux commands I run frequently but don't remember.  The cheatsheet file is just an example.  Please modify your own cheatsheet as you see fit.  If you add everything from the included .bashrc snippet to your own .bashrc or .bash_profile, you can quickly edit the cheatsheet file using 'vicheat'.  I chose that name to follow the same convention as visudo, but you can edit the alias as you see fit.  
```
```
I store my own cheatsheet in a Google Drive folder on my Mac, so it will automatically sync when I update it and I can use the same cheatsheet across multiple systems.  This is purely optional and isn't really supported on Linux anyway, so store the cheatsheet file wherever you like on your own system.  Just remember to change '~/Google\ Drive/home/command_cheatsheet' to the path of your own cheatsheet file every time it appears in the .bashrc snippet.
```
```
If you choose to include the optional 'thecheat' function, you'll need to have cowsay and lolcat installed, and you'll want to put thecheat.cow in your cows folder (Check 'man cowsay' for the location of the cows directory.  On my Mac/homebrew cowsay setup, it's located at: /usr/local/Cellar/cowsay/3.04/share/cows)
```
I hope this is useful to some people out there, and I welcome your feedback!  Happy cheating!
